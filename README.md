### Implementation of Belief Lifting

This branch of the repo contains the code for implementing the belief lifting technique that we discussed in the report. 

There are two `ipynb` files:

* `main_SL.ipynb` runs a randomised run based on the parameters in the table based on the Stuart-Landau system;
* `main_WC.ipynb` runs a randomised run based on the parameters in the table based on the Wilson-Cowan system.


Simply run the first (and only) cell in either of the files.
