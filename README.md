### Physics-Informed Factor Graphs for Learning in Complex Dynamical Systems - Code

This is the repository of code accompanying my Master's thesis:

> *Physics-Informed Factor Graphs for Learning in Complex Dynamical Systems* - Siddharth Srivastava


Keep in mind that this is not the full repository of all code that was ever written or experimented on in the thesis. This repository only contains the runnable code for the scenarios presented in the thesis - the only branch of the massive research tree that made it to the final report. The link to the former is below:

However, reader beware, the above repository is incredibly messy - hence the existence of this cleaner, minimal repository. 

To use this repository, simply switch to either the Belief Lifting or the Aggregator Factor branch to experiment in generating the plots in Chapter 4. To generate the plots in Chapter 3, simply change the `nr` variable in the belief lifting branch to 1.
